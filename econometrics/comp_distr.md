# Comparing two distributions

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

In analyzing RCT, we have seen how to test the sharp null,
and how to test the hypothesis that the treatment has zero
effect on average.
We may also be interested in testing the hypothesis that the
distribution of $$Y (1)$$ and $$Y (0)$$ are different.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. let $$X_1, .., X_n$$ be a random
sample, with CDF F and $$Y_1, .., Y_m$ be a random sample, with
CDF G
â€¢ We are interested in testing the hypothesis
$$H_o : F = G$$
against
$$H_a : F = G$$
