# Perfectly competetive market

Perfect competition is a common market structure with very desirable properties, so
it is useful to compare other market structures to competition.

Economists say that a market is perfectly competitive if each firm in the market is a
price taker that cannot significantly affect the market price for its output or the prices
at which it buys inputs. Why would a competitive firm be a price taker? Because
it has no choice. The firm has to be a price taker if it faces a demand curve that is
horizontal at the market price.


Perfectly competitive markets have five characteristics that force firms to be price takers:
1. The market consists of many small buyers and sellers.
2. All firms produce identical products.
3. All market participants have full information about price and product characteristics.
4. Transaction costs are negligible.
5. Firms can easily enter and exit the market.
