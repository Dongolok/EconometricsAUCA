## What is microeconomics
The word economy comes from the Greek word for “one who manages a household.” At first, this origin might seem peculiar. But, in fact, households and
economies have much in common.
A household faces many decisions. It must decide which members of the
household do which tasks and what each member gets in return: Who cooks dinner? Who does the laundry? Who gets the extra dessert at dinner? Who gets to
choose what TV show to watch? In short, the household must allocate its scarce resources among its various members, taking into account each member’s abilities,
efforts, and desires

## Course Description
This course provides a thorough introduction to microeconomic theory. We will start with the basics of Calculus in order to work with Microeconomics models. Then, we will look at the basic ideas of tradeoffs, opportunity cost, and the benefits of trade, we will study how the market forces of supply and demand cause prices to be what they are. We will see the sense in which market economies are efficient, and the way governments can make our economy less or more efficient. We will delve behind the supply curve to see how firms choose their production levels to maximize profits, culminating in the model of perfect competition.
