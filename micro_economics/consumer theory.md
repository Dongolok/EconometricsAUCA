# Cosnumer theory

To answer questions about individual decision making, we need a model of individual behavior. Our model of consumer behavior is based on the following premises:
- Individual __tastes__ or __preferences__ determine the amount of pleasure people derive from the goods and services they consume.
- Consumers face constraints or limits on their choices.
- Consumers maximize their well-being or pleasure from consumption, subject to the constraints they face.

## Sturcture of consumer theory

1. Preferences. We use three properties of preferences to predict which combinations, or bundle, of goods an individual prefers to other combinations.
2. Utility. Economists summarize a consumer’s preferences using a utility function, which assigns a numerical value to each possible bundle of goods, reflecting the consumer’s relative ranking of these bundles.
3. Budget Constraint. Prices, income, and government restrictions limit a consumer’s ability to make purchases by determining the rate at which a consumer can trade one good for another.
4. Constrained Consumer Choice. Consumers maximize their pleasure from consuming various possible bundles of goods given their income, which limits the amount of goods they can purchase.
5. Behavioral Economics. Experiments indicate that people sometimes deviate from rational, maximizing behavior.

## Properties of Consumer Preferences

- Completeness
- Transitivity
- More Is Better

## Indiffernce curves

Proposition:
- Higher is better
- Downward sloping
- Never cross
- One indifference curve through any given bundle
