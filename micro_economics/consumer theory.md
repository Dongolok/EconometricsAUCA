# Consumer theory

To answer questions about individual decision making, we need a model of individual behavior. Our model of consumer behavior is based on the following premises:
- Individual __tastes__ or __preferences__ determine the amount of pleasure people derive from the goods and services they consume.
- Consumers face constraints or limits on their choices.
- Consumers maximize their well-being or pleasure from consumption, subject to the constraints they face.

## Sturcture of consumer theory

1. Preferences. We use three properties of preferences to predict which combinations, or bundle, of goods an individual prefers to other combinations.
2. Utility. Economists summarize a consumer’s preferences using a utility function, which assigns a numerical value to each possible bundle of goods, reflecting the consumer’s relative ranking of these bundles.
3. Budget Constraint. Prices, income, and government restrictions limit a consumer’s ability to make purchases by determining the rate at which a consumer can trade one good for another.
4. Constrained Consumer Choice. Consumers maximize their pleasure from consuming various possible bundles of goods given their income, which limits the amount of goods they can purchase.
5. Behavioral Economics. Experiments indicate that people sometimes deviate from rational, maximizing behavior.

## Properties of Consumer Preferences

- Completeness
- Transitivity
- More Is Better

## Indiffernce curves

Proposition:
- Higher is better
- Downward sloping
- Never cross
- One indifference curve through any given bundle

## Utility Functions

Let's move from verbal representation of preference assumptions to mathematical representation.
We assume that any persons preferences generated by some mathematical function. For example your preferences for place of work is generated by $U(job market, nature) = \sqrt{JobMarket*Nature}$$ formula.


If we knew the utility function—the relationship between utility measures and every
possible bundle of goods—we could summarize the information in indifference maps
succinctly. Lisa’s utility function, U(Z, B), tells us how many utils she gets from Z
pizzas and B burritos. Given that her utility function reflects her preferences, if Lisa
prefers Bundle 1, (Z1, B1), to Bundle 2, (Z2, B2), then the utils she gets from the first
bundle are greater that from the second bundle: U(Z1, B1) 7 U(Z2, B2).
For example, suppose that the utility, U, that Lisa gets from burritos and
pizzas is
$$U(Z,B) = \sqrt{Z*B}$$.
From Equation, we know that the more she consumes of either good, the greater
the utility that Lisa receives. Using this function, we can determine whether she would
be happier if she had Bundle x, with 16 pizzas and 9 burritos, or Bundle y, with 13 of
each. The utility she gets from x is 12 (= 216 * 9) utils. The utility she gets from
y is 13 (= 213 * 13) utils. Therefore, she prefers y to x. The utility function is a
concept that economists use to help them think about consumer behavior; utility
functions do not exist in any fundamental sense.

## Marginal Utillity

## Slope and shape of indifference curves

The slope of indifference curve
is the rate at which you're willing to give up
one good to get another.

__Graphs are taken from Jonathan Gruber Microeconomics course__


**MRS = \frac{- \Delta P }{\Delat M} = \frac{-MU_{movies}}{MU{pizzas}}

The marginal rate of substitution is diminishing. And that's because of the diminishing marginal utility. Marginal utility diminishes,
because each additional movie is worth less to you
that the one before. Each additional pizza is worth less to you
than the one before.


## Budget constraint

Knowing an individual’s preferences is only the first step in analyzing that person’s
consumption behavior. Consumers maximize their well-being subject to constraints.
The most important constraint most of us face in deciding what to consume is our
personal budget constraint.

The slope of the budget line is called the __marginal rate of transformation (MRT)__:
the trade-off the market imposes on the consumer in terms of the amount of one good
the consumer must give up to purchase more of the other good:

$$MRT = \frac{-P_z}{P_B}$$
