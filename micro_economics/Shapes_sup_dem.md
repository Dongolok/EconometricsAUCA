# Shapes of Supply and Demand curve

## Price elasticity of Demand

The price **elasticity of demand** (or in common use, the elasticity of demand) is the
percentage change in the quantity demanded, __Q__, in response to a given percentage
change in the price, __p__, at a particular point on the demand curve. The price elasticity
of demand (represented by $$\varepsilon$$, the Greek letter epsilon) is
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{percentage change in price}} =
\frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}$$

---

For example,
if a 1% increase in the price results in a 3% decrease in the quantity demanded, the
elasticity of demand is $$\varepsilon$$ = -3%/1% = -3.3 Thus, the elasticity of demand is a pure
number (it has no units of measure).

## Price elasticity of Supply

Just as we can use the **elasticity of demand** to summarize information about the shape
of a demand curve, we can use the elasticity of supply to summarize information
about the supply curve. The price elasticity of supply (or elasticity of supply) is the
percentage change in the quantity supplied in response to a given percentage change
in the price. The price elasticity of supply (represented by $$\eta$$, the Greek letter eta) is
