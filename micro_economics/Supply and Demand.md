# Supply and Demand

Supply and Demand are two forces in the market that jointly decides what quantity of the good to produce and at which price to sell that good.

## Markets

```mermaid
graph TB
    Producers-->Market Supply
    subgraph one
    end
    subgraph two
    Cosumers-->Market Demand
    end
```

```note
For now we will assume, that markets are perfectly competetive. It means, that no single seller or buyer could influence the price of good. If one seller increases the price for good, nobody would buy from him and the market price of the good will not change. Example is foreign exchange markets, agricultural markets, internet related markets(Ebay, Amazon) etc.
