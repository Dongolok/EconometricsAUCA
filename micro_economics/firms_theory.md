# Firms theory

## Plan

1. The Ownership and Management of Firms. How businesses are organized affects who makes decisions and the firmâ€™s objective, such as whether it tries to maximize profit.
2. Production. A firm converts inputs into outputs using one of possibly many available technologies.
3. Short-Run Production. In the short run, only some inputs can be varied, so the firm changes its output by adjusting its variable inputs.
4. Long-Run Production. The firm has more flexibility in how it produces and how it changes its output level in the long run when all factors can be varied.
5. Returns to Scale. How the ratio of output to input varies with the size of the firm is an important factor in determining the size of a firm.
6. Productivity and Technical Change. The amount of output that can be produced with a given amount of inputs varies across firms and over time.

## Production functions

Firm tries to maximize its profit, which equals to revenue minus cost.

A production function is the technology the firm has at its disposal to turn inputs into outputs.
The inputs that it's going to take in are going to be capital **K** and labor **L**.

$$ q = F(L,K)  $$.

**Key distinction from Utility function**.
- Inputs that are fixed.
- Inputs that are variable.

- Short-run:
- - Capital is fixed
- - Labor is variable
- Long-run:
- - Everything is variable

### Marginal product of labor

The marginal product of labor is going
to be the change in quantity produced for a given change
in labor holding capital fix.

$$ MP_L = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L} \vert_{\bar{K}} $$.

### Isoquants

Isoquants are the firm's indifference curves, which is namely combinations of k and l
which yield the same level of output.
