# How regression is used to find answers for questions

Assume that we are researching question how the age of the person affects his wages.
To answer this question first we need data that have variation in the ages of people, and we want to sat that with the change of age, does that make difference in wages.

$$ wages = ages + error\_term $$

```tip
Basically every empirical paper needs to have three things.
- Outcome variable (Left-hand-side).
- Independent variable (Right-hand-side, explanatory variable)
- variation in the independent variable.
```

```tip
Basically every empirical paper needs to have three things.
We to look at the effect of some x on some y.
We need to have an outcome variable.
What's changing?
So if we want to say, do leaders matter, we have to say, well,
do they matter for what?
And we have to have some variable
that we can collect in our data that we can
look at whether they change.
So you're always going to want to have an outcome variable.
So for example, if we want to look
at whether leaders affect economic growth,
we need to measure economic growth.
We need to measure that across all the different leaders
in our data set.
So this is called the dependent variable.
I'm going to write a lot of equations like this.
So the outcome variable goes on the left-hand side
of this equation.
So sometimes it is often referred
to as the left-hand side variable,
where I'm going to put a variable on the left-hand side.
That means it's on the left side of this equation,
and it's the outcome variable.
It's also called the dependent variable,
because this is the thing that depends
on other things in your regression.
The second thing we need, so in this case
it's going to be like economic growth.
The second thing we need is an explanatory variable.
We want to say, well, what is going
to be explaining the outcome.
So in this case, as sunny pointed out,
it's going to be leader identity.
We're going to ask, do we have different leaders.
And are they going to affect the outcome?
So that's x.
It goes on the right-hand side of this equation.
So you'll often see it referred to in papers,
you read as the right-hand side variable.
Left-hand side, right-hand side; that's
just the convention that comes from this equation right here.
It's also more formally called the independent variable.
So the idea is this thing moves around independently
and we're going to see how the dependent variable changes
as we move the independent variable.
And then here is the most important thing
or the tricky part comes in here, which
is we need variation in the explanatory or independent
variable.
And so if you have the same leader forever,
so the idea as Sunny said, we're going
to look as leaders change, does the dependent variable change?
If we had the same leader forever,
we would never know if the leader was actually
effecting the dependent variable or not,
because we had the same leader forever.
So you need to have an outcome variable.
You need to have explanatory variable.
And you need this explanatory variable to change.
