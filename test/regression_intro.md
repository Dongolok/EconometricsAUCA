# How regression is used to find answers for questions

Assume that we are researching question how the age of the person affects his wages.
To answer this question first we need data that have variation in the ages of people, and we want to sat that with the change of age, does that make difference in wages.

$$ wages = ages + error\_term $$

```tip
Basically every empirical paper needs to have three things.
- Outcome variable (Left-hand-side).
- Independent variable (Right-hand-side, explanatory variable)
- Variation in the independent variable. (Variation in the independent variable should be "good", unrelated to changes in outcome variable)
```
